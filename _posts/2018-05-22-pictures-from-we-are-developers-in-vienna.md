Last week my colleagues and I attended [We Are Developers](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/) in Vienna, a developer conference with 8000 attendees. We presented and demonstrated the IBM Cloud and the IBM Code developer site. Below are some pictures.

Some of my colleagues: Andrea Overthun, Fernando Cejas, Miriam Oglesby, Niklas Heidloff, Jonas Jacobi, Joe Sepi Crane-Messina, Christine Mayer

I gave a session [When to use Serverless? When to use Kubernetes?](http://heidloff.net/article/when-to-use-serverless-kubernetes). I’m very happy that so many people (800+) attended it. It was a lot of fun and I had great discussions with attendees after it.
