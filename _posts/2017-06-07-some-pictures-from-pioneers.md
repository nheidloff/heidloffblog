Last week I attended [Pioneers](https://pioneers.io/events/pioneers17#/) in Vienna, Austria, to present IBM Watson and the IBM Cloud and to talk with developers. Below are some pictures.

Pioneers is a conference primarily for startups and investors. IBM provides a [program](https://developer.ibm.com/startups/) where qualified startups can receive up to $120K in IBM Cloud credits.

The new team in Germany from left to right: Niklas, Steffi, Marion, Ansgar and Ethan.

The conference was held at the Hofburg Vienna.
